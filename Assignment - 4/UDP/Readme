A. To execute RPCGEN, we require this command: rpcgen rfour1.x

We can see the object files getting generated for both client and server.
Then, we have to seperate the server and the client files accordingly.

B. For Server, 
1. To compile the .c files and link them together, we require this command: make -f Makefile.rfour1
2. Open the terminal, in which all the server files are stored.
3. To run the server, we should execute this command: ./rfour1d

C. For Client
1. To compile the .c files and link them together, we require this command: make all
2. Open the terminal, in which all the client files are stored.
3. To run the server, we should execute this command: ./rfour1 FILE_NAME LOCATION
e.g. ./rfour1 testfile1 /home/gnanadeep/Pictures
4. Verify if the file is copied from the server to client location.
